<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a Software Engineer that enjoys learning and picking up new skills. During my undergraduate career, I obtained
  two degrees, one in Computer Science and one in Applied Mathematics. In my free time outside of work I try to spend 
  every now and then learning something new, either increasing my knoweldge of web development, or reading an article
  related to Computer Science, Mathematics, or Business. Currently I am purisng my MBA at California State University,
  Northridge. Each class I bridge my technical knowledge to the business lessons I've learned in the classroom as
  well as the day to day at my job.
